# SMN_Lua
Gearswap SMN template

*Features*
All the nifty things found in Aeyela's thread: http://www.ffxiah.com/forum/topic/47412/barebones-summoner-gearswap/

This Lua branched off Aeyela's and included the following:

All the bug fixes found in the above thread previously.
Keybind and support for cycling through avatar modes with 1 key.
Keybind for toggling autoBP
Keybind for toggling melee weapon lock
Avatar-agnostic Blood Pacts handling. (NEED SHORTCUTS ADDON)

Don't modify any of the SMN.lua if you don't know what you are doing and why you are doing it. Reason is, the complicated code is in this file and none of the gearsets are. This way, if something doesn't work, it's either a bug (blame me!) or something wrong with your sets...

You will also need the file named as SMN_Gearsets.lua. This file is where your sets are, so you can modify this to create the sets you need without breaking the actual code. This is also where you can chose different keybinds than me. (I use f9-f10-f12)
